# The Mechanical Universe

This project aims to provide descriptions and annotations for every episode of _The Mechanical Universe: The Physics of the Universe_. Graphs and visual representations are integrated into the explanations, using Python's powerful `matplotlib` library, to help clarify and visualize the underlying physics concepts.

## Features

- **Episode Descriptions**: Clear and concise explanations for each episode in _The Mechanical Universe_.
- **Graphs**: Visualizations using `matplotlib` to illustrate physics concepts such as motion, forces, energy, and more.

## Setup

To get started, it is recommended to create and activate a Python virtual environment to ensure all dependencies are isolated for the project. Hereâ€™s how you can set up the project in a virtual environment:

1. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linus:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install the necessary dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib numpy
    ```

4. **Run the project**:

   Once the environment is set up, you can run the provided Python scripts to explore each episode's description and associated graphs.
